Data Holders must be able to respond to changes in the status of Data Recipients and associated software products on the 
CDR Register within 2-5 minutes of the occurrence of the change. Data Holders can accomplish this by polling APIs to 
get current statuses and check the validity of Data Recipients and associated software products, then caching these for
use during consumer data requests.

Metadata Cache Management module of WSO2 Open Banking supports:

1. Retrieving the statuses of Accredited Data Recipient (ADR) software products from the Australian Competition and
   Consumer Commission (ACCC).

2. Validating ADR and software product during:

    - Requests to disclose CDR data
    - Requests to withdraw CDR Arrangement ID
    - Consumer authorizes the CDR Arrangement ID

3. Performing Data Holder responsibilities such as revoking CDR Arrangement ID and removing client registrations.

### Configuring Metadata Management

By default, Metadata Cache Management is configured in WSO2 Open Banking CDS Toolkit as follows:

1. Open  the `<IS_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` file.
2. Update the following configurations as required:

    ``` toml
    [open_banking_cds.metadata_cache]
    enable=true
    update_period=2
    data_recipients_discovery_url="https://api.cdr.gov.au/cdr-register/v1/banking/data-recipients"
    dcr_internal_url="https://<WSO2_OB_IAM_HOST>:9446/api/openbanking/dynamic-client-registration/register"
    apim_application_search_url="https://<WSO2_OB_AM_HOST>:9443/api/am/admin/v2/applications"
    http_request_retry_count=2
    dataholder_responsibilities.bulk_execution=true
    dataholder_responsibilities.bulk_execution_hour=12
    ```

    ``` toml
    [[resource.access_control]]
    context = "(.*)/api/openbanking/metadata-mgt/(.*)"
    secure="true"
    http_method="POST"
    permissions=["/permission/admin"]
    allowed_auth_handlers = ["BasicAuthentication"]
   
    [[open_banking.service_activator.subscribers]]
    subscriber="com.wso2.openbanking.cds.identity.metadata.periodical.updater.internal.MetadataScheduledTaskObserver
    ```

    - `enable` : To enable metadata caching, set the value to **true**.
    - `update_period` : Defines the fetch time for periodical cache update in minutes.
    - `data_recipient_discovery_url` :  The endpoint provided by ACCC for retrieving the statuses of Data Recipients.
